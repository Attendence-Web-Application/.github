# Cloud-Based Academic Attendance Tracking System

## Introduction
Tracking students' attendance manually in class is a painful and repetitive task. A manual attendance system often requires the person to keep a track of everything. This process usually wastes the time of the class and could make a lot of mistakes. Students could forget to sign in or sign out. Students could also be able to sign for other students. The manual records are easy to lose and also hard to do any analytics. However, those problems can be easily solved by an automatic cloud-based attendance system. 

## Goals
The main objective of this project is to keep a track of students' attendance and let faculty get detailed reports of students for better academic management. 

## Technologies Used:
- React.js
- Springboot
